    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework focuses on **data understanding and preparation** for a particular problem and dataset.\n",
    "The data comes from the Residential Property Price Register (RPPR) (https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb.nsf/page/ppr-home-en). The Residential Property Price Register is produced by the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA). It includes Date of Sale, Price and Address of all residential properties purchased in Ireland since the 1st January 2010, as declared to the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty purposes. In this analysis, **we focus on using the data collected by RPPR to build a data analytics solution for residential property price prediction**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each student will work with a different subset of the data collected in a CSV file. The CSV file is named using the format: **ppr-[your-student-number].csv**, e.g., **ppr-12345678.csv** is the data file for a student with id 12345678. You need to work with the CSV file corresponding to your student number, available from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zs1qvajZC_HfUPdM-oox4MUYY838OV2p?usp=sharing. There are 4 parts for this homework. Each part has an indicative maximum percentage given in brackets, e.g., part (1) has a maximum of 40% shown as [40].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(1). [40] Prepare a data quality report for your CSV file. Below you have a set of guideline steps to help you in this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Check how many rows and columns your CSV has.\n",
    "    - Print the first and the last 5 rows.\n",
    "    - Convert the features to their appropriate data types (e.g., decide which features are more appropriate as  continuous and which ones as categorical types). \n",
    "    - Look for duplicate rows and columns. Consider whether it makes sense to keep them or drop them.\n",
    "    - Look for constant columns. Consider whether it makes sense to keep them or drop them.\n",
    "    - Check the logical integrity of your data. \n",
    "    - Save your updated/cleaned data frame to a new csv file.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    For the updated CSV and data frame (after column/row removal):\n",
    "    - Prepare a table with descriptive statistics for all the continuous features.\n",
    "    - Prepare a table with descriptive statistics for all the categorical features.\n",
    "    - Plot histograms for all the continuous features.\n",
    "    - Plot box plots for all the continuous features.\n",
    "    - Plot bar plots for all the categorical features.\n",
    "    - Discuss your initial findings.\n",
    "    - Save the initial discussion of your findings into a single data quality report PDF file. The PDF report         should focus on the key issues identified in the data and discuss potential strategies to handle them. Simple listing of tables and plots without discussion of findings will not receive full marks. To receive full marks you need to show your understanding and analysis of the dataset, through a detailed discussion for each feature. The report should be concise and complete, the goal is not to make the report long for the sake of length,  but to cover all the important aspects of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2). [30] Prepare a data quality plan for the cleaned CSV file. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Mark down all the features where there are potential problems or data quality issues.\n",
    "    - Propose solutions to deal with the problems identified. Explain why did you choose one solution over \n",
    "    potentially many other. It is very important to provide justification for your thinking in this part and to  list potential solutions, including the solution that will be implemented to clean the data.\n",
    "    - Apply your solutions to obtain a new CSV file where the identified data quality issues were addressed. \n",
    "    - Save the new CSV file with a self explanatory name. \n",
    "    - Save the data quality plan to a single PDF file.\n",
    "        \n",
    "(3). [15] Exploring relationships between feature pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Choose a subset of features you find promising and plot pairwise feature interactions (e.g., continuous-continuous feature plots or continuous-categorical plots or correlation plots). \n",
    "    Explain your choices.\n",
    "    - Discuss your findings from the plots above. Do you find any features or feature combinations that are indicative of the target outcome? Explain in plain words (a short paragraph) the story of your findings so far.\n",
    "    \n",
    "(4). [15] Create a few new features (at least 3) with the aim to better capture the problem domain and the target outcome. You can do this by adding new data from external data sources relevant to this prediction problem, or by transforming, extending or combining the existing features. Justify the steps and choices you are making by using tables or plots to make convincing arguments. Add these features to your clean dataset and save it as a CSV file with a self explanatory name. "
